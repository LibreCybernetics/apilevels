# API Levels

Hello! This is the source code for [Android API Levels](https://apilevels.com), a microsite that displays Android versions and their corresponding identifiers for Android developers. It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Changes merged into the `main` branch are automatically deployed.

## Getting started

To make contributions, you can submit pull requests with changes to the relevant files. If you would like to build the website locally, follow these instructions:

1. Install the [correct version](/.ruby-version) of Ruby, ideally using a tool such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).
2. Install the project Ruby dependencies: `bundle install`.
3. Start the local Jekyll server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The website should now be visible in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:4000/.
